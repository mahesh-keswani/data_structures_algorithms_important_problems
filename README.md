# Data Structures and Algorithms

Implementation of important Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.



## List of implementations

### Arrays
- Two Number Sum, Three Number Sum, Four Number Sum
- Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quicksort, Quickselect
- Majority element 
- Continous largest range
- Maximum sum subarray

### Trees 
- Validate BST, Invert Binary Tree, Find node closest to element x, Sums of each branch, All Nodes at distance k from target node, Max Path Sum, Diameter of tree, 
- DFS, BFS, Recursive and Iterative Preorder Inorder Postorder
- Vertical order traversal, Top View, Bottom View, Left View, Right View, Diagonal traversal, Spiral Order traversal, 
- Find all possible trees from given inorder, check if two Bsts are same, BST to Doubly Linked List, All root to leaf paths
- Check if two trees are symmetric, Populate Next Right pointers, Find all paths with sum k
- AVL Tree

### Graph 
- Articulation Point using Tarjan's algorithm
- Find the size of every river ( matrix of 1's and 0's )
- Count number of islands
- Find shortest path from source to destination in matrix
- Convert O's To X's Which Are Completely Surrounded By X
- Word search in 2d board of letters

### Disjoint Sets
- Basic implementation of Disjoint Set
- Detect cycle in undirected Graph
- Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree using Disjoint Set

### Heaps
- Find Kth largest element
- Minimum cost to connect ropes
- Find element closest to x 
- Find top k frequent elements
- Continous Median
- Min heap implementation from scratch

### Linked List 
- Singly LL
- Detect Loop, Remove Loop
- Reverse LL
- Merge two sorted LL into single sorted LL
- Sum of two Linked List

### String 
- Group Anagrams
- Minimum number of cuts to make string palindrome
- Longest palindromic substring
- Add two strings
- Print the strings which are not the prefix of others
- Multiplication of strings

### Binary search
- Search in sorted matrix
- Find first and last occurence of element X
- Count number of times sorted array is rotated
- Search element x in nearly sorted array
- Search in infinite sorted array
- Peek element
- Median of two sorted arrays

### Knapsack Variations
- Count subsets with sum K 
- Find two subsets of array with equal sum 
- Find two subsets with minimum difference
- Count the pair of subsets with difference k 

### Stack
- Sort the stack using one other stack 
- Check if Linked List is palindrome
- Max stack 
- Nearest greater element to left and right 
- Nearest smaller element to left and right 
- Stock Span 
- Max Area Histogram
- Max area in binary matrix 
- Min stack with and without constant space.
